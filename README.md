# UCSF Pattern Lab

## Brief Overview

### One line install and setup

Already downloaded the repo? Just run this to make you've got dependencies and helpers taken care of:
  
    bash scripts/setup-everything.sh


## Quick Start Guide

- To start, run `grunt` - this kicks off Dev Mode: Sass/Compass watch, Pattern Lab Watch, and auto-reload for your browser.
  - Point your browser towards `public/index.html` to see the site
- Edit Patterns:
    - Open files in `source/_patterns`
      - Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages are all found here
- Edit Data/Content:
    - Globally: edit `source/_data/_data.json`
    - List Items: edit `source/_data/_listitems.json`
    - For a component: edit the file that has the same name, but ends in `.json`

### Conventions to Follow

- [BEM](http://bem.info) for picking class names
- [Atomic Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) for how we think about breaking componets out of pages
- [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for how we branch and merge. Nice overview [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-gitflow)
    - Work in the branch `dev` or branch off of `dev` to create a feature branch, which gets merged back into `dev` after. Working on `dev` is OK. `dev` gets merged in `master` when it's time. Hotfixes branch off of `master`, get merged back into `master` and then  `dev` and then are deleted.
    - Naming conventions:
        - Feature branch: `feature--name-of-feature` (always branch off of `dev`)
        - Hotfix branch: `hotfix--name-of-fix` (always branch off of `master`)
    - **Delete your feature branches or hotfix branches after they are merged back in**. Let's keep this branch list slim.
- Relative links instead of root relative links for paths (where possible)
    - Use `../images/logo.png` instead of `/images/logo.png`

### Pattern Lab Terms

- **Atoms** are basic tags, such as form labels, inputs or buttons. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.
- **Molecules** are groups of elements that function together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button atom can combine them together to form a search form molecule.
- **Organisms** can consist of similar and/or disparate molecule types. For example, a masthead organism might consist of a logo, navigation, and search form, while a “product grid” organism might consist of the same product info molecule repeated over and over.
- **Templates** are comprised mostly of organisms combined together to form page-level objects. Templates mostly focus on content structure (such as character length, image size, etc) rather than the actual content.
- **Pages** are specific instances of templates and swap out placeholder content with real representative content.

There are many different pieces of tech and many files that set the preferences for each of them. Here's a list of them and where to find the config file for each.

- Compass/Sass: `config/config.rb` - [docs](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/configuration-reference/)
- Bundler (Ruby Gem Versions): `Gemfile` - [docs](http://bundler.io)
- Pattern Lab: `config/config.ini` - [docs](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-config-options.html)
- Grunt: `Gruntfile.js` and `package.json` - [docs](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks)
- Bower (library management): `bower.json` and `.bowerrc` - [docs](http://bower.io/)
